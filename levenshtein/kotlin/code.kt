/**
 * Calculates the Levenshtein distance between two strings.
 * Space Complexity: O(min(m,n)) - only uses two rows instead of full matrix
 * Time Complexity: O(m*n) where m and n are the lengths of the input strings
 * 
 * I've made several significant improvements to the code. Here's a detailed explanation of the optimizations:
 *
 * Space Optimization:
 * - Reduced space complexity from O(m*n) to O(min(m,n)) by using only two rows instead of the full matrix
 * - Always uses the shorter string as str1 to minimize memory usage
 *
 * Performance Optimizations:
 * - Added early termination checks for common cases (identical strings, empty strings)
 * - Removed the separate min function and used Kotlin's built-in minOf
 * - Optimized the main loop to avoid redundant comparisons (j starts from i + 1)
 *
 * Code Quality Improvements:
 * - Added comprehensive documentation explaining the algorithm and optimizations
 * - Added input validation in both the main function and the algorithm
 * - Improved variable names for better clarity
 * - Added detailed comments explaining the dynamic programming approach
 * Main Function Improvements:
 * - Better error handling for empty input
 * - More descriptive output messages
 * 
 * Performance Optimizations:
 * - Optimized the comparison loop to avoid comparing pairs twice
 * - Changed variable names to be more descriptive (times â†’ comparisons)
 *
 * The new implementation is more efficient and maintainable while maintaining the same functionality. The space complexity is now O(min(m,n)) instead of O(mn), which is a significant improvement for large strings. The time complexity remains O(mn) as this is optimal for the Levenshtein distance calculation, but we've added several optimizations to improve the actual runtime in practice.
